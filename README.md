# Quantum-Enhanced Climate Prediction Model

A hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model for climate prediction that combines traditional neural networks with quantum circuits using TensorFlow and Cirq.

## Overview

This project implements a novel approach to climate modeling by leveraging quantum computing capabilities alongside classical deep learning techniques. The model processes climate variables (temperature, pressure, and humidity) through a hybrid architecture that includes:

- Classical encoder network
- Quantum processing layer
- Classical decoder network

## Features

- Quantum circuit implementation using Google's Cirq framework
- Custom TensorFlow quantum layer integration
- Climate system simulation with realistic variable interactions
- Visualization of predictions vs. initial states
- Configurable grid size and quantum circuit parameters

## Requirements

```
numpy
cirq
tensorflow
matplotlib
seaborn
tqdm
```

## Architecture

### QuantumClimateLayer

The core quantum processing component that:
- Implements parameterized quantum circuits
- Processes climate data through quantum operations
- Converts quantum states back to classical information

### ClimateSystem

Simulates a basic climate system with:
- Temperature diffusion
- Pressure-temperature relationships
- Humidity variations
- Grid-based spatial representation

### QuantumClimateModel

Combines classical and quantum processing:
1. Classical encoding of input data
2. Quantum processing of encoded features
3. Classical decoding to climate predictions

## Usage

```python
# Initialize the model
grid_size = 10
n_qubits = 6
climate_system = ClimateSystem(grid_size=grid_size)
model = QuantumClimateModel(grid_size=grid_size, n_qubits=n_qubits)

# Generate and process climate data
climate_system.initialize_random()
initial_state = np.stack([
    climate_system.temperature,
    climate_system.pressure,
    climate_system.humidity
], axis=-1)

# Make predictions
prediction = model(input_data)
```
